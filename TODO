* kucomm.c ioctl function: check whether 'int' type argument still needs pointer.
* gpumm.c mm_clear_* functions: write them.
* gpumm.c host mem map allocation/free functions: different types of map may need
  special vma flag setting to work-around the restriction checks.
* kucomm.c: ku_request_t has been modified, so read() and its related functions
  must be changed. Especially the request buffer, which was fixed size before, but
  now needs changing size according to depon and depby numbers.
